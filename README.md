## Dataset

The project uses the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset, available on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

To use this dataset:

1. Download the `creditcard.csv` file manually from the link above.
2. Place it in the `data/raw/` directory of this repository.

## How to Run

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the preprocessing and model training scripts:

```
python scripts/preprocess.py
python scripts/train_model.py
```

To launch the interactive dashboard:

```
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Notes

- The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing.
- Processed data and trained models will be generated locally.
- This project was designed to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow.
